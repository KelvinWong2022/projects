 I am very sorry to say that due to personal reasons and after a period of careful consideration ,I have decided to resign the Senior  Analyst Programmer and it will be effective from Oct 31, 2022.
       I hope that my departure will not bring the company great inconvenience. I wish Belle continue success.
Yours sincerely,
Kelvin Wong
